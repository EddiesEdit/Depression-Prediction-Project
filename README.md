# End-End Depression PredictionÂ¶
Your Goal: Your goal is to use data from a mental health survey to explore factors that may cause individuals to experience depression. This Notebook is looks into machine leaning and Data science liberies. the aim of this project is to build a machine learning model that is capable of predicting whether or not and individual is depressed through the data provided by Kaggle.

I am going to take the following approach

Problem Defination
using the following dataset from Kaggle. Can i predict wether or not an individual is depressed?

# Data
kaggle believed that the data is self explanatory so they didnt provide us with data dictionary here is the lint to the data: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s4e11/data

The dataset for this competition (both train and test) was generated from a deep learning model trained on the Depression Survey/Dataset for Analysis dataset. Feature distributions are close to, but not exactly the same, as the original. Feel free to use the original dataset as part of this competition, both to explore differences as well as to see whether incorporating the original in training improves model performance.

File
train.csv - the training dataset; class is the binary target (either e or p)
test.csv - the test dataset; your objective is to predict target class for each row
sample_submission.csv - a sample submission file in the correct format

# Evaluation
according to kaggle we we're asked to evaluated the model with (Accuracy Score).


# Features
the features of this dataset is self explanatory and Kaggle did not provide any features dictonary along the dataset
